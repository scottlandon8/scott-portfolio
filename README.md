# About Me
My name is Landon Scott (He/Him). I am a MISM 16 student and this is my final semester. I am from Utah and have lived there most of my life. I went to Webet State Univeristy for my undergraduate. I have been married for almost 4 years and have a son. 

My hobbies are basketball, golfing, spending time with my family, and church. 

# What I hope to learn
How to effectively tell the story of the data using visualizations. Once I graduate I will be moving back to Utah with my family and begin working in Salt Lake City.
