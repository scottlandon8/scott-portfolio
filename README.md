### About Me
My name is Landon Scott (He/Him). I am a MISM 16 student and this is my final semester. I am from Utah and have lived there most of my life. I went to Webet State Univeristy for my undergraduate. I have been married for almost 4 years and have a son. 

My hobbies are basketball, golfing, spending time with my family, and church. 

#### What I hope to learn
How to effectively tell the story of the data using visualizations. Once I graduate I will be moving back to Utah with my family and begin working in Salt Lake City.

### Class Exercises
#### Flourish Walkthrough
This first chart was made in Flourish. Showing some Coronavirus data
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8531417"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Tableau Walkthrough
This second chart is made in Tableau. It shows the data of the percent of Americans that trust a particular news organization. The highest was the Wall Street Journal and ABC news. We put emphasis on the lowest three which were InfoWards, Occupy Democrats, Palmer Report, and Breitbart. This was a nice introduction the Tableau.

# Final Project
## Final Project Part I
[Check out my final project Part I](final_project_LandonScott.md)
This is the beginning of our final project. Starting to sketch out an idea on paper in class along with potential data visualizations we could see being in this story. 
Getting feedback on the story from our class peers and then making adjustments based on their feedback. We also were to identify data sources we though would be particularly helpful in creating our story. 

## Final Project Part II
[Check out my final project Part II](final_project_part2.md)
The part 2 of our project was focussed on creating a real draft of our story. We needed to create visualization in our tool of choice (Tableau, Flourish, Datagram, or others) and then interview 2-3 people to get feedback on our visualizations. I found this very helpful, not only from our interviews but also from instructor feedback. We are supposed to be able to pinpoint places in our story or visualizations that need work and identify anything that is confusing. 

## Final Project Part III
[Check out my final project Part III](final_project_part3.md)
Part 3 is where all the work is supposed to come together. We have gone through multiple rounds of interview with classmates and other people, we have sketched and re-sketched, found new data, thought of new ways to tell our story, created a story in a Shorthand (a very cool tool), and we have reworked our story in a way we believe is the best way to present it. Then we actually presented it in class and got direct feedback. There is a direct link to my final presentation in the part 3 link or you can use the link below.
