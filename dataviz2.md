# Flourish Invividual Debt-to-Ratio Country Visual
After playing around with the data for a while and still thinking about the chart we had made above. I decided to do a simple area chart.
I felt that instead of looking at every graph at once and almost at a distance it would be nice next for our viewer of the data to be able 
to look at each country individually and toggle between them. With respect to color here it was not too crazy. I just kept one color across the 
different countries. I picked a neutral color. 

I tried to find a way that you could select two or more countries at a time but with my limited time trying to figure out floursish I was unsuccessful.
I do believe that these three charts above build on each other. For someone looking at the data, the first chart gives them insight into a country in 2017.
The second chart allows them to see each chart from afar and compare and contrast different countries all on the same chart which is what I believe gives
the chart its value. This third chart might be argued as too simple, but I think it builds upon the other two by giving a person the ability to look up
close at the Debtto-GDP ratio for an individual country that they wanted to investigate further.
