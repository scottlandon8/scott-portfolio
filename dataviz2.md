# Flourish Invividual Debt-to-Ratio Country Visual
After playing around with the data for a while and still thinking about the chart we had made above. I decided to do a simple area chart.
I felt that instead of looking at every graph at once and almost at a distance it would be nice next for our viewer of the data to be able 
to look at each country individually and toggle between them. With respect to color here it was not too crazy. I just kept one color across the 
different countries. I picked a neutral color. 

I tried to find a way that you could select two or more countries at a time but with my limited time trying to figure out floursish I was unsuccessful.
