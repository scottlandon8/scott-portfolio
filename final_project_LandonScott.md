# This is the Page for my final project

## Outline
What I want to show is that many of us do not get the proper exercise. The negative impact of not getting enough exercise. The benefits of exercising. Then a call to action of exercising more. 


Potential outline for story: Maybe exercise benefits in general > Where we are at currently in exercise statistics > Downsides of not exercising > Long-term benefits > Call to action
