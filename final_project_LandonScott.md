# This is the Page for my final project

## Outline
What I want to show is that many of us do not get the proper exercise. The negative impact of not getting enough exercise. The benefits of exercising. Then a call to action of exercising more. 


Potential outline for story: Maybe exercise benefits in general > Where we are at currently in exercise statistics > Downsides of not exercising > Long-term benefits > Call to action

From class story map

## Data
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr112.pdf">CDC National Health Statistics Report</a>
Shows the percent of adults age 16-64 who met the CDC recommended time for exercise. 
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/physical-activity.htm">CDC: Lack of Physical Exercise</a>
This is an artical from the CDC highlighting the key points that only 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 5 high school aged kids are getting the adequate and recommended amount of exercise. 
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/a1-2019.pdf">bls.gov data on how we spend our time</a>
This shows how we spend our time. It as survey that shows how most Americans spend all their time. The important aspects here are leisure activities. I want to use this data as motivating evidence that we do indeed have time to exercise we just have to make it happen. 
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity-adult-17-18/overweight-obesity-adults-H.pdf">CDC Overweight, Obesity, and Severe Obesity in US over time</a>
This shows the trend over time of how Americans have increased in weight over time. 
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/leisure.htm">BLS: Leisure time on an average day</a>
Similar to one mentioned above. Depicts how we use our time.
