#Part II of Final Project

After part 1 I felt like a received a lot of feedback and criticism on how to make the story better. 
From our class critique I understood that I needed to make my story more direct. Exercise itself is too general
of a topic. So I settled on the idea of pitching the importance of exercise to college students. Most people know
the general benefits of exercising so the challenge is motivating students to exercise for a reason outside
of the reasons they already know. For me developing this story has helped me want to exercise more. 

## Wireframing and Storyboards
This first chart is from the CDC. According to their research only about 1 in 4 Americans get adequate exericise.
I decided to give infogram a try here and see if I could get one of those people charts showing the proportion.

### How we spend our Leisure Time
The next 3 charts are all using the same data. They show how we as Americans, and specifically the age groups
of 20-24 and 25-34 year olds spend their leisure time. The majority of our leisure time goes to TV, computers,
screens, etc. and then trickles down from there. I wasn not sure which way I preferred showing the data and 
wanted some feedback on these charts from my interviews.

### Change in BDNF
This is really where I want to make my point to college students on the importance of exercise. 
When we exercise our brains produce a chemical Brain-derived neurotrophic factorÂ (BDNF). This
chemical acts like a food for our brain and help the dentrites and synapses grow at a faster rate.
This is really important for people who are learning a lot or taking in a lot of information or 
learning a new skill. BDNF has been shown to help take information, skills, and knowledge to long-term
memory at a faster pace which in turn accelerates learning. 

So when we exercise we are actually really helping ourselves learn faster. The great thing about the
data from the study is that we actually don't have to be some crazy exercise person to get the best
BDNF results. Moderate exercise at either 20 or 40 minutes had the best results in terms of producing 
more BDNF.

### Shorthand Walk Through
I decided to give a shot at putting my story together on shorthand to some experience with it.
It definitely is not in its final stage, but I thought it would be nice to get some experience
using it and to get some feedback on the set up, the story, and the visualizations all in one
place. 

Here is the link to my shorthand story: https://preview.shorthand.com/zXPLtRPJYRSiJv6X

# Interviews and Feedback
### User Research Protocol
The goal of my research and interviews is to get real feedback on how my story flows. If it is
is choppy in anyway, motivating, and clear. I would like to have an understanding of how the visuals
I have created a taken. If they are being received the way that I have intended them to or if they
are missing the mark. 

The questions I am going to as for each chart are below:
1. What is your initial reaction to the chart?
2. What do you like?
3. What don't you like?
4. Is there anything unclear or confusing about the chart?
5. Is there anything you think is not needed?
6. Would anything else make it more clear or understandable?
7. What is the point that you take away from the chart?
8. Do you like the title?

In regards to the story I am going to ask:
1. Do you like the title?
2. Does the title want to make you learn more?
3. In your words, what is the point of this website?
4. Do you like the website from an aesthetics standpoint?

### Interviews
24 year old, female
Chart on CDC Exercise Rates
1. That it is crazy. Makes me wonder if it is true because it is so low.
2. Easy to understand. Immediately know what it is trying to tell me.
3. Don't know. It is a pretty simple chart. Nice to look at. 
4. No, you have to use the legend to know exactly what it is saying. The colors don't make it obvious.
5. No.
6. Not really.
7. That Americans do not exercise. 
8. Long. Gets to the point. Don't know how else you would say it but it feels long.

Charts on how spend our leisure time. 
I showed the treemap first. 
1. It is easy to understand. Wish I could see the data on the other three blocks. 
2. I like the minutes on there with the category.
3. Nothing to pressing. Color is not my favorit. 
4. No. 
5. Don't need the measure values highlight color.
6. No, it is pretty clear.
7. That we watch way too much TV.
8. Title is okay. Kind of boring. 

I asked for opinion on the treemap compared to the bar chart:
I like the treemap because it is different, it is more fun to look at. However,
I would say the bar chart is easier to understand at a glance. I like that the
tree map has it broken down into more categories. Overall, treemap.

BDNF Chart
1. First thought was "What are the labels". Had to look at it for a bit. But that data is interesting. Shows a real difference. 
2. I like that it tells me that anything is better than nothing. 
3. Don't like the labels. They don't mean anything. 
4. Why is the moderate the highest?
5. No. 
6. New labels haha. 
7. Anything is better than nothing when it comes to exercising.
8. Good... but boring. 

53, Male

First Reaction I like it. A good visual. Big difference.

What do you like? Good visual. Not a lot of people are exercising. I am a grey.

What don't you like? How many people are actually on there? Title is a bit long? Americans meeting CDC criteria? Only 25% of Americans are Exercising? Over 75% of Americans Are Not Exercising. Make legend bigger. Center the title.

Does anything confuse you? No.

Is there anything unnessicary? No.

Would anything else be helpful? Bigger Legend.

What is the point you take from the graph? That people don't exercise. Surprises me. We have a problem.

First Reaction Little more difficult to read. Don't like the colors. I like pie Charts in these situations. Round.

What do you like? Nothing.... Measure weight values. Different ages is cool. Surprising.. Maybe

What don't you like? Communicating/Socialing over talking. Rec over Outdoors. Can the labels be bigger.

Does anything confuse you? Not really.

Is there anything unnessicary? Bold title. "How we use our leisure time" in minutes as a subtitle.

Would anything else be helpful?

What is the point you take from the graph? We waste a lot of time. That we have time.

Like the bar graph better. 48, Woman

First Reaction Crazy the increase. Surprised the moderate was the highest.
What do you like? Easy to read.
What don't you like? Don't know what CON means. Think of a better title? "Give your brain the food it needs. BDNF.", "Moderate exercise can help boosts BDNF"
Does anything confuse you? The labels.
Is there anything unnessicary? Don't think so.
Would anything else be helpful? Add the number. Why does it say F1 on hover, and give it a % for visual.
What is the point you take from the graph? Even moderate exercise helps a lot... BDNF.
