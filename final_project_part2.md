# Part II of Final Project
[Return to Home Page](/README.md)
<br>
After part 1 I felt like a received a lot of feedback and criticism on how to make the story better. 
From our class critique I understood that I needed to make my story more direct. Exercise itself is too general
of a topic. So I settled on the idea of pitching the importance of exercise to college students. Most people know
the general benefits of exercising so the challenge is motivating students to exercise for a reason outside
of the reasons they already know. For me developing this story has helped me want to exercise more. 

## Wireframing and Storyboards
This first chart is from the CDC. According to their research only about 1 in 4 Americans get adequate exericise.
I decided to give infogram a try here and see if I could get one of those people charts showing the proportion. 

### Most of us do not exercise

### How we spend our Leisure Time
The next 3 charts are all using the same data. They show how we as Americans, and specifically the age groups
of 20-24 and 25-34 year olds spend their leisure time. The majority of our leisure time goes to TV, computers,
screens, etc. and then trickles down from there. I wasn not sure which way I preferred showing the data and 
wanted some feedback on these charts from my interviews.

### Change in BDNF
This is really where I want to make my point to college students on the importance of exercise. 
When we exercise our brains produce a chemical Brain-derived neurotrophic factorÂ (BDNF). This
chemical acts like a food for our brain and help the dentrites and synapses grow at a faster rate.
This is really important for people who are learning a lot or taking in a lot of information or 
learning a new skill. BDNF has been shown to help take information, skills, and knowledge to long-term
memory at a faster pace which in turn accelerates learning. 

So when we exercise we are actually really helping ourselves learn faster. The great thing about the
data from the study is that we actually don't have to be some crazy exercise person to get the best
BDNF results. Moderate exercise at either 20 or 40 minutes had the best results in terms of producing 
more BDNF.

### Shorthand Walk Through
I decided to give a shot at putting my story together on shorthand to some experience with it.
It definitely is not in its final stage, but I thought it would be nice to get some experience
using it and to get some feedback on the set up, the story, and the visualizations all in one
place.

# Interviews and Feedback
### User Research Protocol
The target audience of my story is college students. Specifically, students here at CMU.<br>

My approach to finding individuals was pretty simple. The first is my wife, she is a recent
college graduate, I wanted to see if the story was motivating for her and her take on it. The
second interview was both of my parents. They just have a good eye for seeing little details that
a lot of people gloss over so I wanted to see what they could pick apart from my story. The third 
is my brother, he is a 22 year old college student and I wanted to see if it was motivating for 
him and his thoughts on it. <br>

The goal of my research and interviews is to get real feedback on how my story flows. If it is
is choppy in anyway, motivating, and clear. I would like to have an understanding of how the visuals
I have created a taken. If they are being received the way that I have intended them to or if they
are missing the mark. 

The questions I am going to as for each chart are below:
1. What is your initial reaction to the chart?
2. What do you like?
3. What don't you like?
4. Is there anything unclear or confusing about the chart?
5. Is there anything you think is not needed?
6. Would anything else make it more clear or understandable?
7. What is the point that you take away from the chart?
8. Do you like the title?

In regards to the story I am going to ask:
1. Do you like the title?
2. Does the title want to make you learn more?
3. In your words, what is the point of this website?
4. Do you like the website from an aesthetics standpoint?

### Interviews
24 year old, female
<br>
Chart on CDC Exercise Rates
1. That it is crazy. Makes me wonder if it is true because it is so low.
2. Easy to understand. Immediately know what it is trying to tell me.
3. Don't know. It is a pretty simple chart. Nice to look at. 
4. No, you have to use the legend to know exactly what it is saying. The colors don't make it obvious.
5. No.
6. Not really.
7. That Americans do not exercise. 
8. Long. Gets to the point. Don't know how else you would say it but it feels long.

Charts on how spend our leisure time. 
I showed the treemap first. 
1. It is easy to understand. Wish I could see the data on the other three blocks. 
2. I like the minutes on there with the category.
3. Nothing to pressing. Color is not my favorit. 
4. No. 
5. Don't need the measure values highlight color.
6. No, it is pretty clear.
7. That we watch way too much TV.
8. Title is okay. Kind of boring. 

I asked for opinion on the treemap compared to the bar chart:
I like the treemap because it is different, it is more fun to look at. However,
I would say the bar chart is easier to understand at a glance. I like that the
tree map has it broken down into more categories. Overall, treemap.

BDNF Chart
1. First thought was "What are the labels". Had to look at it for a bit. But that data is interesting. Shows a real difference. 
2. I like that it tells me that anything is better than nothing. 
3. Don't like the labels. They don't mean anything. 
4. Why is the moderate the highest?
5. No. 
6. New labels haha. 
7. Anything is better than nothing when it comes to exercising.
8. Good... but boring. 

53, Male and 48, Female<br>
CDC Chart
1. I like it. A good visual. Big differnce in those who do and don't exercise.
2. Its just really clear. Hard to misunderstand. Not a lot of people are exercising. 
3. How many people are there on this chart... I don't know what the ratio is and it is a bit distracting. Title is a bit long. It needs some revision. 
Americans meeting CDC criteria? Only 25% of Americans are Exercising? Over 75% of Americans Are Not Exercising. Make legend bigger. Center the title.
4. Nothing really confusing about it. 
5. No. 
6. No. Maybe if the legend was bigger.
7. That people don't exercise. Surprises me. We have a problem.
8. Already addressed in 3

How we spend our time chart:
1. First Reaction Little more difficult to read. Don't like the colors. I like pie Charts in these situations. Round.
2. What do you like? Awkward pause.... Measure weight values. Different ages is cool. Surprising.
3. Communicating/Socialing over talking. Rec over Outdoors. Can the labels be bigger. Better labeling. Don't like the color.
4. Not really confusing. 
5. Bold title. "How we use our leisure time" in minutes as a subtitle.
6. Better labeling.
7. We waste a lot of time.
8. Could be better. No suggestions though.

When asked about the comparison with the bar chart the consensus was the bar chart was probably clearer to understand. 

BDNF Chart
1. Reaction Crazy the increase. Surprised the moderate was the highest.
2. Easy to read.
3. Don't know what CON means. Think of a better title? "Give your brain the food it needs. BDNF.", "Moderate exercise can help boosts BDNF"
4. The labels.
5. Don't think so.
6. Add the number. Why does it say F1 on hover, and give it a % for visual.
7. Even moderate exercise helps a lot... BDNF.
8. Addressed earlier.

22 year old, male, college student
1. That is really low. We are bad at it.
2. It is really simple and straighforward. Nice to look at. 
3. I don't know if the colors are my favorite, but it is not that big of a deal. 
4. Not really. 
5. Not really.
6. No.. maybe make the key more prominent.
7. That we do not exercise as a society haha. 
8. Title is fine. 

Chart of leisure time:
1. Makes sense. Still hurts to look at but makes sense. Not the easiest to read. Would be nice if it was clearer. 
2. It is a cool chart. Unique, but needs to be clearer. 
3. The clarity haha. The color isn't my favorite either. Why can't I see those boxes?
4. Just that I can't see the boxes. 
5. Hmmm not really.
6. Just make it easier to read how the time say minutes in the boxes and I want to be able to read the boxes. 
7. We spend a lot of time things that aren't that important. 
8. Hmmm not great, but I don't really know what to change it to. 

I would say the bar chart is probably clearer, but there is something cool about the other one and how the space represents the time. I like them both. 

BDNF chart:
1. What are those labels. I think it makes the point pretty clearly about BDNF. 
2. Easy to read. Interesting the moderate exercise is the highest. Helps the point I think. 
3. The labels what is "Vig40". Why are you using this pinkish red?
4. Not really, pretty straightfoward chart. 
5. Nope. 
6. I would maybe add the percents if you could just for reference. 
7. That exercising really helps increase BDNF. 
8. Title is plain, but it works. 

Overall I would say the story is that as a college student we can help ourselves from a school and learning standpoint by exercising. 
I thought it flowed well. It was not super long, which is fine, because I think it got your point across. It is nice to look at mostly, just
change some of the colors so it aligns better with your other stuff. Cool tool though to create a website like this. 

### Findings
I would say the big findings is that for the most part people got what I wanted them to get from each chart and from the story as a whole. 
There are definitely things to change with each chart. I got mixed feedback on the treemap vs. bar chart for the leisure time section. I am not sure what to do there.
I will probably need to clean them both up a bit and get more feedback. Mostly, I feel like people liked the treemap but it just needs to be done better and made
easier to read.<br>

All my titles are not great. I didn't realize how boring they were until I was going through the story with people. However, most liked my story title. They thought
it was engaging. Most everyone gave feedback on the colors I used in the charts. This was not intentional. I made the charts before I made the story in shorthand, but I will 
need to give some thought to how I want the colors to be presented.

Overall, I really need to give the charts some work and make sure that they are really easy to read at a glance. This includes titles, colors, labels, and such. 

### What to fix
With the CDC Chart
1. Fix the color
2. Make the legend bigger
3. Better title

With the treemap/bar chart for leisure time:
1. Change the color
2. Treemap, fix the categories and makes sure they are all mostly showing
3. Treemap, add minutes in the label on the categories
4. Get feedback on both again after revisions 
5. Pick one and go with it
6. Work on a better title 

With the BDNF chart:
1. Change the color
2. Change the labels
3. Make the title engaging. Right now it seems a bit boring and even difficult to understand 
4. Make the part of the story about BDNF easier to understand

Overall:
1. Rehearse, get the story down to a 60 second overview that is engaging.
2. Make sure every think aligns from a color standpoint
3. Create moodboard and persona and see where it can fit logically into the story.
