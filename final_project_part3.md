# How the Project Was Developed
This project was developed in 3 parts.

This is part 3. I was talk about how the project changed during this part and what changes were made
as a result of the things done in part 2 that were then implement in part 3. 

Part of our requirements was to interview 3 individuals about our project and get their feedback. As
a result of that feedback I was able to make some pretty significant changes to my graphs. These changes
involved changing the color of the charts, the titles of the charts, the overall title of the presentation, 
and othe elements of the presentation that were unclear. I found this exercise so useful because I was able
to collect their thoughts but also get the common changes they brought up between the three of the them. It
made it abundantly clear how the presentation was being received. 

Some of the best feedback I got back was on our part 2 turn in from whoever graded it. I thought the feedback
was clear and to the point. From there I understood the need to make some parts of the story more readable 
like the BDNF portion. It was said to make it less "clinical", which was tough to do but I did my best to 
address this and make changes. 

The other feedback was that the title was a bit confusing, I believe I had it as "The underutilized way to 
get better results in college". I don't know why was trying to be so mysterious, but after getting the 
feedback it clicked for me that I didn't need to do that. So I changed the title to "Exercise: the Underutilized
Study Habit". I thought it was more appropriate and to the point. 

The other addition I made was adding a social media chart usuage graph. I felt that during the story I wanted
the person reading or listening to understand that we do have more time than we think we do and one of the 
things that robs us the most of our time is social media. I had the leisure chart on their already which I really
liked (the treemap), but it didn't have social media data which I felt was important to the story.
