# Part III
## How the Project Was Developed
This project was developed in 3 parts. 

### You can check out part 1 here: [Part 1](final_project_LandonScott.md)<br>
This is the beginning phase where we kind of mapped out our original ideas of what we thought we 
could do for a project. My initial story was called "Exercise: the best medicine". After getting some
great feedback on how exercise itself is really broad and the call to action to exercise is really 
broad. I had to narrow my focus a bit. This is where Group X at CMU was actually brought up by another
classmate as a potential call to action. My initiial sketches weren't great but I actually did end up
following those ideas to the end. 

The goal was to have an idea, sketch and wireframe, and find data that supported our story. You can
find all that in the link above. 

### You can check out part 2 here: [Part 2](final_project_part2.md)<br>
In this section we were supposed to make some more leaps in our stories journey. We developed further
our sketches and wireframe and put them to actual data visualizations. I expanded my story a bit further
by talking about what Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and its impact on learning abilities. 
Because I decided to tailor my story to CMU students and the benefits of exercising as a student. 

We help interviews for feedback which you can read in part 2 and I also created my first draft of my
story in shorthand. I got some great feedback from the TA/Professor that I needed to fix make the title
more understandable and also make the BDNF portion easier to understand as a reader. 

### Intended Audience
The intended audience at the very beginning was so broad... because probably everyone can benefit from some more exercise in their life.
However, I knew and was told that I need to narrow that down. I initially thought to narrow it down specifically to college students, but
a classmate suggested maybe it be directly targeted at CMU students and Group X. I thought that was a great idea, so my research then tailored
more towards students. With that in mind I decided to try to tackle the excuse of "I don't have time" and find some real benefit to students
other than the regular known benefits and I learned about BDNF. This enabled me to kind of pitch the idea of exercise as a study habit and that
CMU provides resources to do it at Group X. 

### Adjustments from part II
Part of our requirements was to interview 3 individuals about our project and get their feedback. As
a result of that feedback I was able to make some pretty significant changes to my graphs. These changes
involved changing the color of the charts, the titles of the charts, the overall title of the presentation, 
and othe elements of the presentation that were unclear. I found this exercise so useful because I was able
to collect their thoughts but also get the common changes they brought up between the three of the them. It
made it abundantly clear how the presentation was being received and what was not so easy to understand. 

Some of the best feedback I got on part 2 was from whoever graded it. I thought the feedback
was clear and to the point. From there I understood the need to make some parts of the story more readable 
like the BDNF portion. It was said to make it less "clinical", which was tough to do but I did my best to 
address this and make changes. I essentially, just tried to make it easier to read. The reader probably
does not want to the science behind BDNF, but they are probably interested in the fact that it helps you
learn and retain information and skills. 

The other feedback was that the title was a bit confusing, I believe I had it as "The underutilized way to 
get better results in college". I don't know why was trying to be so mysterious, but after getting the 
feedback it clicked for me that I didn't need to do that. So I changed the title to "Exercise: the Underutilized
Study Habit". I thought it was more appropriate and to the point. 

The other addition I made was adding a social media chart usuage graph. I felt that during the story I wanted
the person reading or listening to understand that we do have more time than we think we do and one of the 
things that robs us the most of our time is social media. I had the leisure chart on their already which I really
liked (the treemap), but it didn't have social media data which I felt was important to the story.

As I finished up the project the thing that stood out to me the most is the importance of feedback. Something
may seem very clear to us, but we are not the user or viewer. Interviewing someone about my story or a specific
visualization helped me see what was confusing or the assumptions I had made in creating the story. I think this
lesson is not just data visualizations specific but also important to understant in a lot of different aspects.
