## Critique of the Visualization
The overall summary of the chart is that for someone who has experience with NBA the chart 
is pretty cool. I consider myself as someone who follows the NBA pretty closely, but this 
still took me a secong to get a real idea of what was going on, so the readability needs some
work. 

The chart looks a bit messy. There are axes, diagonal lines, some random labels, and some
random text. I think it could be cleaned up a bit. However, I do really like the ability 
to use team logos as icons. This could backfire though if your reader has no idea who the
teams are. 

I do think after you look at it for a second the chart does deliver the overall message 
well. You can see which teams are performing well offensively, defensively, and who has
the biggest net efficiency. I don't mind some of the rankings, but they seem random. It 
would be better in my opinion if they just highlighted the top particular teams. 

The other point I would add is tick marks with numbers so we can see how efficient the 
teams actually are. We can see that some are more and less effiecient but being able to
put that into some number form would be nice for readibility and comparing.
