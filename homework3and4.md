# Homework 3 and 4

## Data Visualization to Critique: The Efficiency Landscape

## Critique of the Visualization
The overall summary of the chart is that for someone who has experience with NBA the chart 
is pretty cool. I consider myself as someone who follows the NBA pretty closely, but this 
still took me a secong to get a real idea of what was going on, so the readability needs some
work. 

The chart looks a bit messy. There are axes, diagonal lines, some random labels, and some
random text. I think it could be cleaned up a bit. However, I do really like the ability 
to use team logos as icons. This could backfire though if your reader has no idea who the
teams are. 

I do think after you look at it for a second the chart does deliver the overall message 
well. You can see which teams are performing well offensively, defensively, and who has
the biggest net efficiency. I don't mind some of the rankings, but they seem random. It 
would be better in my opinion if they just highlighted the top particular teams. 

The other point I would add is tick marks with numbers so we can see how efficient the 
teams actually are. We can see that some are more and less effiecient but being able to
put that into some number form would be nice for readibility and comparing. 

## Wireframe a solution

The first sketch is me trying to represent the data in a bit of a cleaner way and see if
I feel like it makes it easier to read. Basically, the same approach taken originally but
seeing if I can clean it up a bit. 

The second one, I took some of the emphasis off the defensive and offensive efficiencies. 
I focused mainly on net efficiencies which really brings to light who is being the most 
efficient anyway. This is the point I think the author is trying to make and I think it 
helps get it across. 

## Test the solution
#### Sister
The first person I interviewed was my sister. She knows very little about basketball so I 
hoped it would give a fresh perspective. Even with the changes I made in my first sketch
it took a while for her to see what exactly the point of the graph was. Her response to 
"What do you think this is" was "some kind of city or state effecincies data". She then
asked why there was no title or labels. She mentioned having the points in red made her
believe they were doing poorly when in reality they were the best. 

I gave here some help because I left off a title that this was NBA basketball data and 
it became a little more clear to her. I asked about intended audience and she said people
who are well versed in basketball because this chart did not make sense to her even with
that knowledge. 

We looked at the second chart and she said now having the knowledge that this was about 
basketball that it made it easier to interpret. 

Summary from Sketch 1 from Sister: 
- Have a title, because without it there is no way to know what is happening. 
- Likes the idea of having best teams stand out but change the color. 
- Data points need to be more readable
- Labels on axes would be nice

Summary from Sketch 2 from Sister:
- More readable
- Needs title
- Needs Labels
- Visually easier to understand for someone who knows little about NBA
- Easier for comparison
